This project represents the personnel onboarding management system. You may create onboarding tasks like 'Create Email account', 'Send all documentation files' etc. You may also create employees and assign them some tasks. The set of tasks may be different for each employee: depending on on its position. Each assigned task may change its state to 'completed'.

The project demonstrates these front-end development advantages:

* Vue framework usage together with Element UI package
* Benefits of TypeScript
* Responsive layout implementation

If you want to try &ndash; just clone it and then:

```
~/$ cd personnel_vue

~/personnel_vue/$ npm install

~/personnel_vue/$ npm start
```
